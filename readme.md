### Integer Squared Root Automaton
This project implements a finite state machine (FSM) in VHDL designed to calculate the integer square root of a number.

The FSM is accompanied by a testbench that simulates its operation.  The testbench initiates the calculation process when it detects a "start" signal. Upon completion of the square root calculation, the testbench sets a "done" signal to indicate that the result is ready.
